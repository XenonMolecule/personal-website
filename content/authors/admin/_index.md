Hi, I'm Michael Ryan and I'm an undergraduate researcher of natural language processing in Dr. Wei Xu's NLP X Lab. My research interests include multilingual NLP and memory/knowledge modeling for large language models and my current focus is on multilingual text simplification and multilingual readability.  I have also been Head TA for CS3600: Introduction to Artificial Intellgence under Dr. Mark Riedl and Dr. James Rehg.
